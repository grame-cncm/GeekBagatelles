# GeekBagatelles

Faust DSP cource code of the GeekBagatelles musical piece, a participatory work for smartphones and orchestra, by Bernard Cavanna for the european project “ONE ® IS MORE”, the european network for orchestras, coordinated by orchestre de Pocardie and supported by the creative Europe program.

This app allows whoever wants to perform the piece for smartphones written by the French composer Bernard Cavanna to participate in many concerts in Europe along with different orchestras.

The music is inspired from Beethoven’s “Ninth Symphony” and is using different quotation of the original work.

The originality of the concept is to engage the audience in an instantaneous creation, without prior rehearsals or special musical skill. This is the movement of phones that generate sounds and not a “strumming” on the screen. By becoming a “player” of a musical piece, participants will experience the sensation of being musicians.

## The Smartfaust technological platform

The project is based on the [Faust programming language](http://faust.grame.fr). Faust (Functional Audio Stream) is a DSL (Domain Specific Language), a high-level programming language designed specifically for the development of digital audio applications in real time. Developed by Grame research laboratory since 2002, Faust is the subject of various international scientific collaborations, through several research projects.

### A participatory artistic challenge

With their personal smartphones and having downloaded the app, everybody can interact in harmony with this musical and artistic Europea, programme. This concept offers an infinite range of possibilities, still leaving a large place for research and artistic creation on all levels: sound, visual, design, architectural, sound ecology,social behaviour... This must be viewed as a new garden of the post-digital era.
